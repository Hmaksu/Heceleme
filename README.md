It is a python script that perfectly spell the words in Turkish. (In Turkish there are rules for spelling) Since every word is made up by spells, if there is the voice of every spell, there can be talking script. Next aim of this project is to make it talk.
With the additional lines in the script, it can create several scripts which can execute ".wav" files.
Basically it spells the input then create python scripts and play them, in the end it works. My assumptions were true :)
However, there is a major issue in this project. There are more than 5000 voices in Turkish. That's why I am bored to record every voice, because my microphone is not the best one.
For now it perfectly works but needs lots of ".wav" voices, so I left this project to rest :) maybe one day I'll come back and record the voices.

*You can use this script for your personal good, but if you make money out of it tell me how :) and you may mention my name.

*I completed this project several months ago, but I created my account and wanted to upload this project. That's why, all the files are uploaded on the same date.
